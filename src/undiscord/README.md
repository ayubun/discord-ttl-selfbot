# Undiscord

Undiscord CLI is a fork (and wrapper) of https://github.com/victornpb/undiscord

Files in this directory are *effectively* original to Undiscord, with some exceptions for bugfixes / feature updates:

- Unarchive threads to delete messages within them (on by default)
- TODO: Properly parse index.json from Discord data packages to get DM channels


### This currently uses components from the following Undiscord version:
> v5.2.3
