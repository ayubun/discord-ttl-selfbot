# undiscord-cli

work in progress~

todos:
- fix confirmation prompts (only works with --no-confirm atm)

see repo description for info / goals c:

**Any tool that automates actions on user accounts, including this one, could result in account termination.** (see [self-bots][self-bots]).  
Use at your own risk! ([discussion](https://github.com/victornpb/undiscord/discussions/273)).

If you want a message deletion service that uses Discord bots instead of user accounts, see [ayubun/discord-ttl][discord-ttl]
